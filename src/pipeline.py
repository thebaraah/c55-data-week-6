"""Week 6 assignment: Azure-deployed data pipeline.

This pipeline replaces the local file output from Week 5 with two cloud
targets: raw JSON in Azure Blob Storage and structured rows in Azure
Database for PostgreSQL. When you finish the assignment it will run as a
Container App Job triggered from the Azure Portal or the CLI.

Replace every `raise NotImplementedError` below with a real implementation.
